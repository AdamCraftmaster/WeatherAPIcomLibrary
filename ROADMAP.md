## Unknown future
### Add
- Document the whole library in GitHub Wiki
- More apis for reciving weather, allowing the user to choose their favorite, likely happening in version >=2.x.x or newer
### Change
- Exceptions, making them more easy to catch and debug by library user
- Change how JSON is received internally, by making the object once per library instance, rather than getting the json every time a method is called. (this could give **out of date** information however, not sure of a solution that **lowers the amount of calls** to the API safely)
